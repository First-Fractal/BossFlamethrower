Boss Flamethrower Mode is a mod that gives all of the major bosses a flamethrower. 
Why use this mod? PAIN. That's why.
By default, the flamethrower will come out every 30 seconds, and it will last for 10 seconds, but you can configure it.

The flamethrower will behave differently depending on the boss. 
For Eye of Cthulhu, Eater of Worlds, The Destroyer, Retinazer, Plantera, and DukeFishron, the flamethrower will come out and point of there mouth.
For	Skeletron and Skeletron Prime, the flamethrower is at the bottom. 
For Deerclops, Wall of Flesh, Cultist, and Cultist Clone, it will come out and point of the side of the boss.
For everyone else, except for Moon lord and Spazmatism, then it will come out of the center and points torwards the player target. 
Moon Lord dosn't have flamethrowers because it is almost impossible to see them cause of the darkness. However, you can enable him to have it, but you got to change your lighting to retro or trippy to be able to see it.
